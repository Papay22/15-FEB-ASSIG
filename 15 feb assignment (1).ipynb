    "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI involves the development of algorithms and software that can enable machines to perform cognitive functions like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and planning.\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable machines to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. The goal of machine learning is to create systems that can automatically improve their performance on a specific task over time, as they are exposed to more data.\n",
    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex representations of data. The term \"deep\" refers to the fact that these neural networks can have many layers, sometimes numbering in the hundreds or even thousands. Deep learning models can automatically learn to recognize patterns and features in data, without being explicitly programmed to do so."
